# BryanLoyd.dEV - NuCamp NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB Course

This is a solution to the Week 4 : Backend Services

## Objective

Demonstrate your understanding of using Passport and Express middleware functions to restrict access to specific endpoints in your application to only certain users.

## Instructions

In this assignment, you will be adding more granular control over who is authorized to access which endpoints in your Express server application. You will implement a way to check if a user is an admin, then allow only admins to access certain endpoints. You will also implement allowing users to update or delete the comments that they themselves submitted.
